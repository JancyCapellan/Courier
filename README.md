# Courier

Website and App repo for the courier project

courier folder is the main website made with nextjs + a cusomt express server

courierMobile will have different mobile versions of the app

other courier folders will probably have clones of the original project in a different flavor.
one will be nextjs fullstack with trpc, probably look into using the create-t3 app.

dont use npm install in courier folder, package.json is redundant to package.json in the outer folder of courier.
